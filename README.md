# Basic Python CSV Processor

This project is intended to help those who want to process CSV files in Python and write
to txt files. These are two intermediary formats you can use if you're not interfacing
with a database and need to save a small amount of data.

In this use case, the script processes daily stock prices from a ticker to monthly
averages dissecting them into individual output files per column.
